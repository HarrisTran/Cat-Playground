	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_0": "Once upon a time, there was a big, green ball! It looked like a giant blueberry, but when you took a bite, all you tasted was plastic.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_1": "There was a soft fabric ball with just the right amount of bounce. But sometimes, a cat's claws would get stuck in its threads, leading to hilarious kitty predicaments.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_2": "An old cushion made of non-hairy material. Though a bit rough, it was quite uncomfortable to lie on for too long.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_3": "The cushion had the shape of a daisy flower. It made you feel like you were lounging in a field of singing daisies—a truly \"petal-rific\" experience!",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_4": "An old cardboard box had a peculiar attraction for the cats. It had them pouncing and playing as if they were chasing their wildest dreams.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_5": "A newly decorated cardboard box with tuna illustrations. It made the cats feel like they were floating in the depths of the ocean—a feline underwater adventure!",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_6": "The fishing lures swayed in the wind, looking so real that even the bravest of cats couldn't resist them. Who could blame them? The temptation was reel-y hard to resist!",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_7": "One fishing lure had a wind chime attached. Perfect for those active and sound-loving felines. They couldn't help but dance to the jingle-jangle melody.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_8": "A fancy scratching post made of expensive rope threads. Ideal for keeping those claws in shape.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_9": "Not just for beauty, but also for decoration. Fear not, for there's a carrot-shaped scratching post. A fashionable addition to any cat's scratching repertoire.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_10": "A wooden carving shaped like a fish. Great for throwing, but apparently terrible for eating. Trust me, nobody wants to dine on a woody fish delicacy.",
	"STR_TOY_DESCRIPTION_11": "Soft, adorable, and non-hairy! But, oh my, it's absolutely awful to eat. No one craves a tuna-flavored cotton candy, that's for sure.",

	"STR_CAT_DESCRIPTION_1": "The kitty is just a regular kitty. He has breakfast in the morning and lunch at noon.",
	"STR_CAT_DESCRIPTION_2": "There's a beautiful kitty, but I don't think she's easy to approach. Look at the red color on her fur... It looks like the color of \"chili.\"",
	"STR_CAT_DESCRIPTION_3": "SHARKY!!!! Ahem, I really like him. Because... he looks quite like a SHARK!",
	"STR_CAT_DESCRIPTION_4": "She doesn't like the patch of fur right around her eye. But for me, it's quite attractive, you know.",
	"STR_CAT_DESCRIPTION_5": "I wonder... would we be able to see him if it's dark outside? I mean, without those white spots.",
